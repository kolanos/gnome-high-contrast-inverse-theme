Gnome HighContrastInverse Theme
===============================

For some ungodly reason Gnome decided to drop the HighContrastInverse theme.
Sure it was ugly. But it was the perfect kind of ugly for those with certain
kinds of color blindness / visual impairment. So I'm trying to bring it back
and make it compatible with the latest version of Gnome, using the (still as
of yet) undropped HighContrast theme as a reference.

Wanna Help?
